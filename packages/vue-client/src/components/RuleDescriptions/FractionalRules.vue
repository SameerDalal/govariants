  <h2>Base Setup</h2>

  <p>
    Fractional is a multiplayer variant for any even number of participants.
    Players are grouped into two competing teams:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Team Black</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Team White</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Each team receives points for the area of their
    <strong>Team Colour</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>Parallel Moves</h2>
  <p>
    When all players have submitted a move, all stones are simultaneously placed
    on the board. If two or more players played the same move, a collision
    occurs (see <i>Collision Handling</i>).
  </p>

  <h2>Fractional Stones</h2>
  <p>
    Stones have multiple colours, and the chains of each colour are determined
    individually. As a result chains may overlap with each other. Players place
    stones with two colours, one of them being the players Team Colour, and the
    second colour is shared with a player from the other team.
  </p>

  <h2>Collision Handling</h2>
  <p>
    When two or more players submit the same move, a single stone is placed at
    that position, with all colours of the colliding players.
  </p>

  <h2>Capture</h2>
  <p>
    Chains without liberties are removed as usual. When multiple chains
    simultaneously lose their last liberty, first all Old Chains are removed
    simultaneously, then all New Chains without liberties are removed.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>New Chains</strong> are those including a stone placed this round.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Old Chains</strong> are those that donâ€™t include a stone placed
      this round.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Note that removing Old Chains might free up liberties of New Chains,
    allowing them to avoid capture (like in normal go, a stone that captures a
    Ko).
