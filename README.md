# Go Variants
A place to play Go variants, brought to you by the OGF community.

## Set up
In the root of this repo, run

```
yarn install
```

This will install dependencies in the three main subdirectories in `packages/`: `client/`, `server/` and `shared/`.

To run the app, you can run

```
npm start
```

This will start two dev servers.  One is a React server listening on `localhost:3000`, and the other is an Express server listening on `localhost:3001`.
